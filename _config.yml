user_description: Since 2014 Iâ€™ve worked across multiple disciplines in Technology including Engineering, Robotics and Automation, Business Development and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). In 2016 I joined Tanda, the worlds number one workforce management system.  Today I work in the UK office, based in London helping our clients achieve workforce success. I do my best work where technology meets people, developing systems to help teams become more effective and scale up their impact.
